# Setting up an Environment:
Setting up an environment for Java development is the first step in the initial learning phase of Java. Installing the Java Development Kit (JDK) and a Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, is a part of this.

# Java Development Kit:  
The full-featured Java SDK is known as the Java Development Kit (JDK). It includes the compiler (javac) and tools (such as javadoc and jdb), in addition to everything the JRE has. 

# Integrated Development Environment (IDE): 
IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. The most popular Java IDE are Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA. You can download Eclipse from [here](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or IntelliJ IDEA from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).
